# Write a program which capitalizes the first letter of a given string.

# sentence = raw_input("Please enter a sentence using all lowercase letters.")
# sentence = sentence.capitalize()
# print sentence

# I won't focus on it now because I don't understand how to accomplish it from what I've read but I will extend this lesson to capitalize the first letter of each sentence given multiple sentences.
